# Spam
This project implements a machine learning model to classify SMS (Short Message Service) or email messages as spam or not spam (ham). The classifier is trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of spam and non-spam messages, and it uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text data and extract relevant features.
