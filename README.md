# SMS/Email Spam Classifier

This project implements a machine learning model to classify SMS (Short Message Service) or email messages as spam or not spam (ham). The classifier is trained on a dataset containing labeled examples of spam and non-spam messages, and it uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text data and extract relevant features for classification.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: The text data is preprocessed using techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming to extract meaningful features.
- **Machine Learning**: The preprocessed text features are used to train a machine learning model, such as a Naive Bayes classifier, to predict whether a message is spam or not spam.
- **Streamlit Web Application**: The trained model is deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input a message and receive a prediction on its spam classification in real-time.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/spam-classifier.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit web application:

   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Access the web application in your browser and input a message to see its spam classification prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train the spam classifier is not included in this repository. However, you can obtain similar datasets from sources such as [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), or other publicly available datasets.
